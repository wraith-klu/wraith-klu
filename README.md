## ✨ A Poetic Touch  

📜 *Because code is human too...*  

💡 I am not just lines of code I write,  
But late-night struggles and morning light.  
A learner who fails, then tries once more,  
Each bug a lesson, each fix a door.  

🌌 Dreams are compiled, though errors stay,  
I debug my path in my own way.  
💻 Beyond the screen, I seek to be,  
A builder of hope, through technology.  

In loops and queries, my journey flows,  
Through AI’s mind where wisdom grows.  
Each dataset whispers, patterns unfold,  
A story of logic, endlessly told.  

From code that builds to dreams that scale,  
I debug the errors, I ship the tale.  
A learner, a builder, with visions untold,  
Crafting tomorrow in functions of gold.  
                                - Wraith 👻
